class NeighGraph(KStar):
    """
    Computes the directed neighbourhood graph (DNG) based on the kstar optimal neighbourhood selection and
    other DNG-based quantities. Inherits from class KStar. The DNG is stored in nind_list and can be
    retrieved using the kstar (inherited from Kstar class) and nind_iptr attributes. Can compute and store
    distances and vector differences between nodes connected on the DNG. Can compute and store the number
    of points in common in the neighbourhoods of couples of nodes connected on the DNG. Can use the common
    neighbours to give a geometric estimate of the overlap between neighbourhoods (various methods
    implemented).

    Attributes:
        nspar (int): total number of edges in the (sparse) directed graph defined by kstar i.e. the sum
            over all points of (kstar -1).
        nind_list (np.ndarray(int), optional): size nspar x 2. Each row contains a couple of indices of
            edges connected in the DNG stored in order of increasing point index and increasing neighbour
            rank. Therefore, nind_list assigns a unique index from 0 to nspar-1 to all the edges in the DNG.
        nind_iptr (np.array(int), optional): size N+1. For each element i, it stores the 0-th index in
            nind_list at which all the edges of the form [i,.] (i.e. the ones connecting point i to its
            neighbours) start. The last entry is set to nind_list.shape[0].
        common_neighs_array (np.array(int), optional): size nspar. At position  p, it contains the total
            number of points in common between the neighbourhoods of the two points forming the p-th
            directed edge of the neighbourhood graph.
        common_neighs_mat (np.ndarray(float), optional): size N x N. Entry (i,j) contains the total number
            of points in common between the neighbourhoods of points i and j.
        neigh_similarity_index (np.ndarray(float), optional): size nspar. At position p, it contains an estimate of
            the overlap between the neighbourhoods of the two points forming the p-th directed edge of the
            neighbourhood graph.
        neigh_similarity_index_mat (np.ndarray(float), optional): size N x N. Entry (i,j) contains an estimate of the
            overlap between the neighbourhoods of points i and j if (i,j) is an edge of the directed neighbourhood
            graph; it contains a 0 otherwise.
        neigh_vector_diffs (np.ndarray(float), optional): size nspar x dims. At position p, it stores the
            vector difference from point nind_list[p,0] to point nind_list[p,1].
        neigh_dists (np.array(float), optional): size nspar. Stores the distances from each point to its
            k*-1 nearest neighbors in the order defined by nind_list.
