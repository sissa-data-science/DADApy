# Quick Example

```python
import numpy as np
from dadapy.data import Data

# Generate a simple 3D gaussian dataset
X = np.random.normal(0, 1, (1000, 3))

# initialize the "Data" class with the set of coordinates
data = Data(X)

# compute distances up to the 100th nearest neighbor
data.compute_distances(maxk=100)

# compute the intrinsic dimension using 2nn estimator
id, id_error, id_distance = data.compute_id_2NN()

# compute the intrinsic dimension up to the 64th nearest neighbors using Gride
id_list, id_error_list, id_distance_list = data.return_id_scaling_gride(range_max=64)

# compute the density using PAk, a point adaptive kNN estimator
log_den, log_den_error = data.compute_density_PAk()

# find the peaks of the density profile through the ADP algorithm
cluster_assignment = data.compute_clustering_ADP()

# compute the neighborhood overlap with another dataset
X2 = np.random.normal(0, 1, (1000, 5))
overlap_x2 = data.return_data_overlap(X2)

# compute the neighborhood overlap with a set of labels
labels = np.repeat(np.arange(10), 100)
overlap_labels = data.return_label_overlap(labels)

```

# Installation
The package is compatible with the Python versions 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12.
The methods of the classes ```DiffImbalance``` and ```CausalGraph``` are only compatible with Python>=3.9.
We currently only support Unix-based systems, including Linux and macOS.
For Windows machines, we suggest using the [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux).

The package requires `numpy`, `scipy`, `scikit-learn`, `jax`, `jaxlib` and `matplotlib` for the visualizations.

The package contains Cython-generated C extensions that are automatically compiled during installation. 

The latest release is available through pip:

```sh
pip install dadapy
```

To install the latest development version, clone the source code from GitHub
and install it with pip as follows:

```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/sissa-data-science/DADApy
```

Alternatively, if you'd like to modify the implementation of some function locally you can download the repository and install the package with:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sissa-data-science/DADApy.git
cd DADApy
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
pip install .
```

The methods of the classes ```DiffImbalance``` and ```CausalGraph``` can be run on GPU, using a suitable installation of JAX on a GPU platform. The code has been tested using JAX v0.4.30 with CUDA 12, which can be installed with:

```sh
pip install --upgrade "jax[cuda12_pip]==0.4.30" -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_cuda_releases.html
```

For more information on the installation of the JAX library on GPUs see the official [repository](https://github.com/google/jax?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).
